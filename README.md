# Our Company Repository

The Inner Sanctum for MyKindOf.tech - all of our administration tasks live in this repo :+1:

This is a community project, we all work remotely and soon will be spread across different continents, lets do everything we can to be as transparent and keep each other in the loop :purple_heart::earth_africa:. 

Issues are how we manage our workflow, so check here first for any tasks you are assigned to and any deadlines etc.:sparkles:

Here's how to contribute:
* Feel free to review the issues and make comments where you have something to contribute to the conversation. Sometimes even just showing you support an idea with a :heart: is nice feedback to our team. 

* If you have a suggestion for an update to a document/code/something that exists within the repo, branch it, make your edit and create a pull request (PR). Not sure how to do that - you can use GitHub's awesome resources to learn how.

* If you have a task to add to our project Kanban - add a note to the correct column on the project and convert it to an issue, tag anyone you feel is relevant :smiley:

* If you have a suggestion for anything, no matter how trivial - raise an issue (we don't just use these for corrections), these are our conversation starting points and then everyone can have a chance to see your suggestion and chat about it.:tada:
